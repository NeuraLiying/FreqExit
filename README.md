# FreqExit: Enabling Early-Exit Inference for Visual Autoregressive Models via Frequency-Aware Guidance

## üß† Abstract

FreqExit is a dynamic inference framework for Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) models, which decode from coarse structures to fine details. Existing methods fail on VAR due to the absence of semantic stability and smooth representation transitions. FreqExit addresses this by leveraging the observation that high-frequency details, crucial for visual quality, primarily appear in later decoding stages 
On ImageNet 256√ó256, FreqExit achieves up to **2√ó** speedup with only minor degradation, and delivers **1.3√ó** acceleration without perceptible quality loss. This enables runtime-adaptive acceleration within a unified model, offering a favorable trade-off between efficiency and fidelity for practical and flexible deployment.

üß© Method
The FreqExit framework introduces frequency-aware guidance to enable dynamic inference in Visual AutoRegressive models. It consists of three core components:

Curriculum-Based Early-Exit Supervision
Integrates layer-adaptive dropout and progressive early-exit loss to encourage expressive representations in shallow layers under a dynamic supervision schedule.

High-Frequency Consistency Loss
Aligns spectral content across generation steps in the wavelet domain, stabilizing high-frequency learning without disrupting early training behavior.

Frequency-Gated Self-Reconstruction
Adds an auxiliary loss branch with learnable sub-band gates to guide frequency-aware spectral learning, improving convergence and generation quality.
